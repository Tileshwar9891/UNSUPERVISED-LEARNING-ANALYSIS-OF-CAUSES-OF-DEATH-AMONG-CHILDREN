# UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-ANALYSIS-OF-CAUSES-OF-DEATH-AMONG-CHILDREN
This study uses unsupervised learning techniques to analyze global child mortality data, aiming to identify patterns and inform effective health interventions.
This report takes us through the application of unsupervised learning techniques for analyzing the causes of death in children under five years old, using data “Causes of death in children under five, 2019” from “Our World in Data” [1], a scientific online resource that focuses on large global problems. The data gives the count of deaths because of various diseases/causes in multiple countries for every year starting from 1990 to 2019. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are implemented for dimensionality reduction. Clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical clustering were implemented for grouping untagged data. [2] The dimensionality reduction and clustering of the child mortality data around the world from 1990 to 2019 identified seven significant components and showed optimal clustering patterns, with imbalance between the countries such as India, Nigeria, and China. Main risk factors which have contributed to this trend were respiratory illnesses, preterm births, and stillbirths. The information presented gives an overview through which evidence, based pediatrics improvement strategies necessary for decreasing child mortality may be undertaken globally.
